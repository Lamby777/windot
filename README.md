# `windot`

## What is it?

This is a simple emoji picker for Linux. It is made with GTK4 and Rust.
It has the following features you might be looking for in an emoji picker:

- Search for emojis
- Recently used emojis
- Picking skin tone variants

### More Features?

Check [the Issues tab][issues]. I kinda use it as a to-do list.

## Installation

You may have dependency issues if you just compile it immediately.
A brief installation guide is included in [this blog post][blog-post].

## Contributions

Yes.

## Dumb stuff

- The name comes from the shortcut most emoji pickers use: `Win` + `.` (dot)
  - It's pronounced "who the hell cares how it's pronounced"
- I created this project to learn GTK and to make my own little emoji picker
  because Emote wouldn't register my clicks sometimes for some reason.
