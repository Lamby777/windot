# `windot`

## What is it?

This is a simple emoji picker for Linux. It is made with GTK4 and Rust.
It has the following features you might be looking for in an emoji picker:

- Search for emojis
- Recently used emojis
- Picking skin tone variants

### More Features?

Check [the Issues tab](https://github.com/Lamby777/windot/issues).
I kinda use it as a to-do list.

## How to use it?

- Install the program and make sure you can run it from command line.
- Use your system's shortcuts feature to bind a key combo to run that command.
- All done! Now you can use the shortcut to open the emoji picker.

## Contributions

Yes.

## Dumb stuff

- The name comes from the shortcut most emoji pickers use: `Win` + `.` (dot)
  - It's pronounced "who the hell cares how it's pronounced"
- I created this project to learn GTK and to make my own little emoji picker
  because Emote wouldn't register my clicks sometimes for some reason.
